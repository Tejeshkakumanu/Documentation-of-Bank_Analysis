### Results / Finding
---------
### what we observed based on all 5 kipâ€™s:

1.On year wise loan amount stats : 
   Analyze the distribution of loan amounts over the years.
   Identify trends in loan disbursements and potentially allocate resources accordingly
   Determine which years have the highest loan amounts, aiding in business planning..
                      
2.Grade and sub -grade wise revolving balance:
    Understand the distribution of revolving balances based on loan grades and subgrades.
    Identify riskier loan segments with higher revolving balances.
    Optimize credit risk assessment and tailor strategies for different grades and subgrades.

3.Total Payment for Verified Status Vs Non-Verified Status:
    Compare the total payments for loans with verified and non-verified statuses.
    Assess the impact of verification status on borrower repayment behavior.
    Adjust verification processes or strategies based on payment trends.

4.State and Last Credit Pull Date Wise Loan Status:
   Monitor loan status changes across states and over time.
   Identify states or time periods with higher default rates or other patterns.
   Optimize collection efforts, risk assessment, or marketing strategies based on these insights.

5.Home Ownership Vs Last Payment Date Stats:
   Explore relationships between home ownership and the timing of last payments.
   Determine whether there's a correlation between homeownership and payment punctuality.
   Tailor communication or support for homeowners based on their payment history.

 ### suggestions:
----------
By this we recommend the bank should concentrate on non-verified customer to verify them and some 
country also should concentrate. And increase the incentives who done these sales then they will be good do work with 
passion. If these things done the loan amount and funded amount can increase in future based on our visualization
